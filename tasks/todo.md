### T3 review

Independent review of the first PR head `f26f98b875ae8506ded7e0634a3fc7a45b6251e7` found an Important race in the export test's pre-capture snapshot and cleanup identity. Fixed in `47c2d8f192f2d92a4fd07539bd9ff3bf28b1ecfa`; focused export instrumentation and full API 35 qualification now pass. Final evidence is outside the repository at `E:\project_benchmark_evidence\t3-reference-camera-controls-20260926\5750a52b8c9e4507a4f5b162a8799cba`, with 9/9 artifact hashes verified and the source manifest refreshed. Independent review of the updated PR head remains pending.
